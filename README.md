## Hi, I'm Lorenz ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer passionate about computer vision and software design.

Without a particular order, things I am interested in: computer vision, software, martial arts, API design, Neapolitan pizza, procedural generation, pen & paper, developer experience, technical writing, reading, pose estimation and more that I might find the time to add later ðŸ˜….

If you want to reach out, feel free to message me on my Twitter, [@holylorenzo](https://twitter.com/holylorenzo)! 

Here on GitHub, I mainly work on better tooling for deep learning in [Julia](https://julialang.org). To do this, I've authored several Julia libraries, including:
- [FastAI.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl), a high-level interface for complete deep learning projects (approved by [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai) creators) (see the [announcement post](https://lorenzoh.github.io/posts/fastaijl_ecosystem.html)),
- [FluxTraining.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/FluxTraining.jl), an extensible training loop with best practices,
- [DataLoaders.jl](https://github.com/lorenzoh/DataLoaders.jl), an efficient, parallel data loader for larger-than-memory datasets
- [Pollen.jl](https://github.com/lorenzoh/Pollen.jl), a documentation system to build beautiful documentation pages for your libraries (see [this example page](https://lorenzoh.github.io/DataLoaders.jl/docs/dev/interactive/))

I'm also part of the [FluxML organization](https://github.com/FluxML). If you're interested in contributing, come say hi on the [Zulip channel](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/237432-ml-contributers) or on the biweekly ML ecosystem call (find the link [here](https://julialang.org/community/)).
